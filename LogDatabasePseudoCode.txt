William's Pseudo Code

View Algorithms:

PrepareLog() {
	Get Time and Date
	Store Time and Date in the Session
}

DisplayLogs(UserID[, Date]) {
	Invoke Controller's "GetLogData"
	Return Logs for assembly into the page
	
}

CreateLog() {
	Get Current Time and Date
	Get Session Stored Time and Date from Login
	Pass these through the Controller's "CreateLog"
}

DeleteLog(LogID, UserID) {
	Get the relevant/correlating Log
	Pass the LogID and UserID through the Controller's "DeleteLog"
}

Controller Algorithms:

GetLogData(UserID[, Date]) {
	Pass the UserID and Requested Date to the Model's "SelectLogs"
}

CreateLogData(UserID, Date1, Time1, Date2, Time2) {
	Assembles and passes data pertaining to the session to the model to be published via the Model's
		"CreateLog" algorithm
}

DeleteLog(LogID, UserID) {
	Passes the UserID and the relevant LogID to the model's "DeleteLog" algorithm
}

Model Algorithms:

SelectLogs(UserID[, Date]) {
	Query the Database for Logs pertaining to the specific UserID and start Date
	Returns a "table" of Logs
}

CreateLog(UserID, Date1, Time1, Date2, Time2) {
	Query the Log Table to create a log containing the following:
		UserID
		Initial Date
		Initial Time
		Final Date
		Final Time
}

DeleteLog(UserID, LogID) {
	If (The UserID correlates to an Admin) {
		Delete the Log correlating to the LogID
	}
}
